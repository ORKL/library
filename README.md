Collection of original report and metadata files that are used by ORKL to
complement the public library of cyber threat intelligence reports. This
repository is used to add reports that are not covered by any of the existing
sources and to provide metadata hints where the PDF metadata or the source
metadata are not sufficient.

In the `corpus` directory the current state of the ORKL library is represented.

The following files can be found in the directory:

* <$REPORT_HASH>.pdf -> Reports not yet in the ORKL CDN (will be imported periodically)
* <$REPORT_HASH>.yaml -> Metadata files that contain a `cdn:` key with the uri of the
    report in the CDN

## Prerequisites

the following requirements need to be installed to use the tool chain:

* Golang (>1.18)
* Exiftool
* Make

on a Debian/Ubuntu system it should be enough to do:

```shell
apt install -y libimage-exiftool-perl golang make
```

**Note:** make sure `$GOPATH/bin` is added to `$PATH`

## Add Reports

1. Fork this repository and clone the fork to your workspace

2. Install prerequisites and make sure `olm` works:

    ```shell
    make install

    olm -help
    ```

3. Use either the `-report` or the `-recursive` command to add one or multiple
    reports to the corpus.

4. Check the .yaml files with `make validate` and also make sure the
    parsed title and other report metadata looks clean and you are happy with
    the entries.

5. Commit to a patch branch and open a pull-request. If your metadata files and
    TLP level of the reports looks good your PR will be approved after
    verification.

## Fix existing entry in ORKL library

If you want to provided better metadata to an entry that is already in the ORKL
library you need to:

1. Bootstrap the .yaml file from the api with `olm -hash <$REPORT_HASH>` or `olm -uuid <$REPORT_UUID>`
2. Edit the .yaml file
3. Open a PR to add the file to the main repo

## Metadata yaml file

the following table is a reference what every .yaml metadata file should contain:

| Key                   | Value                                                      |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| sha1_hash             | sha1 hash as utf8 string                                   |
| title                 | title of the document as utf8 string                       |
| authors               | authors separated by comma as utf8 string                  |
| pdf_creation_date     | date as ISO 8601                                           |
| pdf_modification_date | date as ISO 8601                                           |
| publication_date      | date as string formatted YYYY-mm-dd                        |
| file_names            | original file names as array                               |
| file_size             | file size in byte as integer                               |
| reference_urls        | urls where the original file can be downloaded as array    |
| language              | language as ISO 639-1 two letter codes                     |
| cdn                   | link to the PDF file in the ORKL cdn (if already imported) |

**Note:** the `cdn` key will be omitted for files that are waiting to be imported
